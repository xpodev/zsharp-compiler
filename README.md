# Z# Compiler
This repository contains the source code of the Z# programming language.

Z# is a multi-paradigm, statically typed, dynamically compiled programming language.
It compiles to IL code which means it runs on the .NET ecosystem (currently .NET5 and .NET6) and so it can also interact with programs written in C# or F#.


## Requirements
To build the compiler you need:
 - .NET5/6 SDK
 - The Z# compiler [source code](https://github.com/xpodev/zsharp-compiler/tree/development-v2) (currently on a different branch)

After you have the above requirements, navigate to the solution folder and execute the following command:
```cmd
dotnet build --project ZSharpCompiler
```
If you want to build for a specific target runtime, add one of the following options
```cmd
-f net5.0
-f net6.0
```

# ToDo List
* Only load user defined keywords/operator when their namespace is used (currently always in global scope)
* Generated assembly should not rely on the framework version of the compiler (and also not copy the runtimeconfig.json)
* Wrap literally everything outside of the engine
